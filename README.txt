# 2) ECE 474A (574A for Jason)
#
# 3) Our program takes a behavioral netlist and parses the .txt file using
#    C++ to convert the .txt file and output the converted verily code to 
#    a .v file that can be synthesized and executed and Vivid
#
# 4) Gavin - Helped Collin write the C++ code for the 474a section of the program 
#            and worked a lot on the parsing the input file and creating objects
#            from the parsed lines from the input file.
#    Bob - Helped debug code in Vivid to make sure our code compiled and could be 
#          synthesized in Vivado. 
#    Collin - Helped Gavin write the C++ code for the 474a section of the program
#             and worked a lot on making sure the files were outputting correctly.
#    Jason - Helped with parsing input file and worked on the graph traversal and 
#            determining critical path.
